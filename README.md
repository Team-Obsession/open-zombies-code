# open-zombies-code
The code portion of Open Zombies, in C# for the Unity3D game engine.

The purpose of Open Zombies is to create a round-based zombie survival game with full local, Internet (and maybe LAN) multiplayer support on PC taken in a slightly different development direction than the popular zombies mode. 

Ideally Open Zombies will be able to cater to different playstyles, such as:
  1. The player who wants an interesting progression with lore to explore.
  2. The player who only cares about grinding out to high rounds, likes to train, and wants everything available immediately.
  3. Somewhere in-between.

The non-code assets may be released / linked to later, after a substantial amount have been created.
